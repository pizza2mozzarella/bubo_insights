# Bubo Insights [Wordpress Plugin]

Bubo Insights tracks and display the most useful user navigation data without using cookies or violating privacy. Simple, useful, effective.

It uses AJAX (with jQuery script) to track user information and anonimously fingerprint it. The jQuery script scrapes the otherwise impossibile to get information as the element clicked, the touch capability, screen size etc.. while everything else is collected via the AJAX call headers for the maximum respect of the privacy of the user. IP address is used only to hash the user and then discarded. Does not set or use cookies or session stored data.

Data is collected in an efficient way to keep the database small yet rich of information. The simple yet flexible interface of the plugin permits the execution of deep analytics of the traffic with customizable filters, userbase and timespans.

The plugin is still in it's early stage of realease and will soon add many new innovative ways to analyze the website traffic.
