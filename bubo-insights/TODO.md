# TODO

The following list comprises ideas, suggestions, and known issues.
All of those listed here are in consideration for possible implementation in future releases.

***This is not a roadmap or a task list.***
Just because something is listed does not necessarily mean it will ever actually get implemented.
There are many kind of ideas...
...Some might be excellent ideas but not work well enough.
...Some might be ideas easy to implement but not useful enough.
...Some might be good ideas but not worth the effort.
...Some will appear on future versions! ;)
